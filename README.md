# üõ°Ô∏è SOAR + EDR Project

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to reduce repetitive tasks through automation by implementing a structured process using playbooks.

In this project, the objective is to build a detection rule in **LimaCharlie** to identify the execution of `LaZagne.exe`, an open-source post-exploitation tool used to recover stored passwords on a system.

Once detected, the event is forwarded to **Tines**, where a custom playbook (Story) triggers the following sequence:

1. Notify the user via **email** and **Slack**  
2. Prompt the user with a **YES/NO** question asking whether to isolate the affected machine  
3. If the user selects **YES**, LimaCharlie automatically isolates the machine and sends a Slack message:  
   > `"The computer <computer> has been isolated."`
4. If the user selects **NO**, a Slack message is sent:  
   > `"The computer <computer> was not isolated. Please investigate."`

   > ## üß† Skills Learned

### üîç EDR Integration & Threat Detection

- Developed custom detection rules using LimaCharlie, demonstrating proficiency in endpoint detection and response (EDR) platforms.
- Analysed host telemetry to identify suspicious behavior and trigger actionable alerts.

### ‚öôÔ∏è SOAR Automation

- Automated incident response using Tines, showcasing skills in Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR).
- Designed and implemented a no-code workflow that responded to detections by executing an automated computer isolation action.

### üß© Incident Response Workflow Engineering

- Built real-time alerting and response flow between LimaCharlie, Slack, and Tines.
- Ensured alerts from LimaCharlie detection rules triggered Slack notifications and isolation commands without manual intervention.

### üîó Cross-Platform Tool Integration

- Integrated APIs between multiple security tools and communication platforms.
- Demonstrated technical understanding of webhooks, JSON handling, and API authentication.

### üõ°Ô∏è Risk Reduction via Automation

- Minimised Incident Response time and improved containment efficiency, aligning with best practices for MITRE ATT&CK response strategies.
